        <p>
          Today, Forough Farrokhzad would be almost ninty years old.
          Thetext about the Project.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forugh_Farrokhzad" target="_blank"><b>Forugh Farrokhzad</b></a> was a
          prominent Iranian poet and filmmaker during the middle decades of the 20th century. She was an early feminist
          and one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran" target="_blank"><b>Iran</b></a>'s most important
          female characters. Although she died young, she produced 127 poems, which many critics believe make her the
          greatest female poet in the history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language"
            target="_blank"><b>Persian language</b></a> and one of the luminaries of Persian literature.
        </p>
        <p><b>Forugh</b> rebelled against the strictures of her conservative homeland both in her writing and her
          lifestyle and, as a consequence, faced widespread condemnation.</p>
        <p>She was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran" target="_blank"><b>Tehran</b></a><b>, Iran in
            1935</b>, into an artist family. At the age of 16, she fell in love with <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parviz_Shapour" target="_blank"><b>Parviz Shapur</b></a>, a novice
          writer, and married him. During these years, he published his first collection of poems, <b>The Captive</b>,
          and they had a son named <b>Kamiyar</b>.</p>
        <p>In <b>1954</b>, <b>Forugh</b> divorced and lost custody of her son, since both Iranian law and the fact that
          she was known to have committed adultery dictated that the child go to his father. Nonetheless, she apparently
          remained on cordial terms with her former husband. In 1956, she dedicated <b>"The Wall"</b> to him "in memory
          of our shared past" and with thanks for "his innumerable kindnesses."</p>
        <p><b>Forugh Farrokhzad</b> was a leading lady without supporting power, without the unity of the community, and
          her isolation and loneliness were both brutal and devastating, combined with the strain resulting from the
          collapse of her marriage, these pressures led <b>Forugh</b> to a nervous collapse in the fall of <b>1954</b>.
        </p>
        <p>Following a trip to <b>England</b> in <b>1959</b> to study English and filmmaking, Forugh returned to Iran to
          take up work as a filmmaker. For the remainder of her life, she was active as a producer, editor, and actress
          in various filmmaking projects. Her most prominent production was a documentary on the Iranian leper colony at
          Tabriz, <a href="https://archive.org/details/vimeo-136522352" target="_blank"><b>The House is Black</b></a>,
          which she filmed in <b>1962</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Another Birth</b>, a collection of 35 poems published by <b>Forugh Farrokhzad</b> in <b>1964</b>,
          established her as a significant figure in Iranian literature. <b>Forugh</b> herself considered <b>Another
            Birth</b> as a sign of her growth as a writer. By <b>1965</b>, she had gained enough international
          recognition for UNESCO to produce a film about her life. Unfortunately, <b>Forugh</b> died on February 14,
          <b>1967</b>, from injuries sustained in a car accident.
        </p>
        <p>A posthumous collection of her work, <b>Let Us Believe in the Beginning of the Cold Season</b>, was published
          in <b>1972</b>. This collection introduced new themes, such as loneliness and death, into her writing.
          <b>Forugh</b>'s passion for exploring the world through her poetry was expressed in a letter to her last
          lover, <b>Ebrahim Golestan</b>: <i>"I want to pierce everything and penetrate into all things. I want to reach
            the depths of the earth."</i>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to her professional success, <b>Forugh</b>'s independent lifestyle makes her a role model for
          Iranian women. She lived without relying on any men for support and praised women's subjectivity and freedom.
          She opposed the Middle Eastern concept of veiled women at home, but she also rejected the Western ideal of
          women as mere objects of beauty. <b>Forugh Farrokhzad</b> was a living poem, exemplifying the eternal beauty
          of a divine woman by living her truth.</p>
        <p><b>Forugh</b> expressed her desire to see a better world in a poignant statement: <i>"I wish I could die and
            be reborn to see that the world has changed. That it's not as cruel anymore, and people have lost their
            general miserliness, and nobody marks their house with fences."</i></p>

            represent <b>people, dates, subjects, places</b> etc. as <b>entities</b> and the <b>connections</b> between
            them as <b>relationships</b> in a same graphical representation.
