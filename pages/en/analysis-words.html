          &nbsp;
          &nbsp;
          <p>In this section, we have a different look at Forough’s poems through the new lens of data visualization
            using
            statistical analysis of the main words used by the poet in each book. This type of data analysis could
            provide us with
            the mindset of the poet and brighten the transformative journey of the poet as an influential character in
            forming the
            literature of a nation. This method can be used by sociologists to make accurate determinations and better
            analyses of
            cultural transformations in different societies. For instance, using the data analysis of works of prominent
            writers and
            poets, sociologists can study the intellectual and cultural line of a society and even predict it’s future
            direction.

            In the first step, the total collections published by the poet are analyzed by Voyant. Based on the words
            that have the
            highest frequency, it can be inferred that the main General theme of Forough poems in all of her collections
            is likely
            related to her emotions, personal feelings, and relationships with people. However, as a new sight to
            Forough’s journey,
            we analyze each of her books separately to better understand her literary orientation.

          <p>
            Literary analysis:
            here are five main themes of the book:
            Emotions and Relationships: Words like "heart," "love," "sorrow," "desire," "longing," and "embrace" suggest
            a focus on
            emotions and relationships. This theme may explore the complexities of love, longing, sorrow, desire, and
            the deep
            connections between individuals.
            Introspection and Existentialism: The presence of words such as "soul," "know," "silent," "darkness," and
            "secret"
            indicates themes related to introspection and existentialism. This motif could delve into questions of
            identity, inner
            struggles, personal revelations, and the search for meaning in life.
            Nature and Symbolism: Terms like "star," "night," "moment," and "hope" imply themes of nature and symbolism.
            This theme
            may involve reflections on the beauty and transience of life, as well as the symbolism associated with
            natural elements
            like stars and the night sky.
            Communication and Connection: The inclusion of words like "eye," "gaze," "lip," "kiss," and "body" suggests
            themes
            related to communication and connection. This motif may explore the power of nonverbal communication,
            physical intimacy,
            and the significance of human touch in forming connections.
            Yearning and Aspiration: The presence of words such as "hope," "desire," "longing," and "embrace" points to
            themes of
            yearning and aspiration. This theme may involve the exploration of dreams, aspirations, and the pursuit of a
            better
            future, as well as the emotional journey associated with striving for one's goals.
            These themes offer insight into the overarching motifs and subjects explored within the book, reflecting its
            potential
            focus on the complexities of human experience, relationships, and existential inquiries.
            Based on the density of negative and positive categories we could conclude that “The Captive” which is
            written in the
            first stage of the poet's life possesses mostly a positive theme reflecting her hopefulness and positive
            attitude to
            life. We know that while writing “The Captive” Forough was in Love with Paviz, a love that resulted in the
            marriage
            bond. So, despite the book name that beers a negative meaning, Forough's thoughts and feelings describe her
            as a free
            happy young girl full of hope and Passion for life.

            both
            internal and external. This theme may explore how individuals perceive themselves, others, and the world

            relationships,
            including passion, loss, and the complexities of desire.
            Night and Darkness: Words such as "night," "shadow," "darkness," and "silent" suggest themes related to
            darkness and the
            night. This motif could symbolize various concepts, including mystery, solitude, introspection, and the

            its potential
            focus on the complexities of human emotions, relationships, and existential journeys.
            This analysis can reveal a new interpretation that may not have been discernible before. As it’s obvious
            from word
            analysis, the count of negative and positive words are exactly the same. We know that “The Wall” poems were
            written
            during the last years of marriage of Forough when she was grappling with the problems of a housebound woman
            trapped in
            the bonds of marriage in the traditional society of that time while still loving her husband. This
            struggling situation
            caused the passion, eagerness, and freshness of a young girl to fade. Though a mixture of hope and
            frustration existed
            in her equally. The Wall was dedicated to her ex-partner as a tribute to their deep love.
