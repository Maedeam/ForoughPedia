            <br />
            In this section, we have a different look at Forough’s poems through the new lens of data visualization
            <br />
            using statistical analysis of the main words used by the poet in each book.
            <br />
            This type of data analysis could provide us with the mindset of the poet and
            <br />
            brighten the transformative journey of the poet as an influential character in forming the literature of a
            nation.
            <br />
            This method can be used by sociologists to make accurate determinations and better analyses of cultural
            transformations in different societies.
            <br />
            For instance, using the data analysis of works of prominent writers and poets,
            <br />
            sociologists can study the intellectual and cultural line of a society and even predict it’s future
            direction.

          <br />
          <p>
            In the first step, the total collections published by the poet are analyzed by Voyant.
            <br />
            Based on the words that have the highest frequency,
            <br />
            it can be inferred that the main General theme of Forough poems in all of her collections is likely related
            to
            <br />
            her emotions, personal feelings, and relationships with people.
            <br />
            However, as a new sight to Forough’s journey,
            <br />
            we analyze each of her books separately to better understand her literary orientation.

          <p>
            <em><strong>Literary Analysis</strong></em>
            <br />
            Here are five main themes of the book:
            <br />
            Emotions and Relationships:
            <br />
            Words like "heart," "love," "sorrow," "desire," "longing," and "embrace" suggest a focus on emotions and
            relationships.
            <br />
            This theme may explore the complexities of love, longing, sorrow, desire, and the deep connections between
            individuals.
            <br />
            Introspection and Existentialism:
            <br />
            The presence of words such as "soul," "know," "silent," "darkness," and "secret"
            indicates themes related to introspection and existentialism.
            <br />
            This motif could delve into questions of identity, inner
            struggles, personal revelations, and the search for meaning in life.
            <br />
            Nature and Symbolism:
            <br />
            Terms like "star," "night," "moment," and "hope" imply themes of nature and
            symbolism.
            <br />
            This theme
            may involve reflections on the beauty and transience of life, as well as the symbolism associated with
            natural elements
            like stars and the night sky.
            <br />
            Communication and Connection:
            <br />
            The inclusion of words like "eye," "gaze," "lip," "kiss," and "body"
            suggests themes
            related to communication and connection.
            <br />
            This motif may explore the power of nonverbal communication,
            physical intimacy,
            and the significance of human touch in forming connections.
            <br />
            Yearning and Aspiration:
            <br />
            The presence of words such as "hope," "desire," "longing," and "embrace" points
            to themes of
            yearning and aspiration.
            <br />
            This theme may involve the exploration of dreams, aspirations, and the pursuit of
            a better
            future, as well as the emotional journey associated with striving for one's goals.
            <br />
            These themes offer insight into the overarching motifs and subjects explored within the book, reflecting
            its potential
            focus on the complexities of human experience, relationships, and existential inquiries.
            <br />
            <br />
            Based on the density of negative and positive categories we could conclude that “The Captive” which is
            written in the
            first stage of the poet's life possesses mostly a positive theme reflecting her hopefulness and positive
            attitude to
            life. We know that while writing “The Captive” Forough was in Love with Paviz, a love that resulted in the
            marriage

          <p>
            <em><strong>Literary Analysis</strong></em>
            <br />
            Here are five main themes of the book:
            <br />
            Inner and External Perception:<br />
            Words like "eye," "heart," "soul," and "gaze" suggest a focus on
            perception,
            both
            internal and external.
            <br />
            This theme may explore how individuals perceive themselves, others, and the world
            around them, as
            well as the depth of their emotions and desires.
            <br />
            Love and Longing:
            <br />
            The presence of words like "love," "longing," "desire," "kiss," and "sorrow" indicates
            themes centered
            around love, emotional connections, and yearning.
            <br />
            This theme may delve into various aspects of romantic
            relationships,
            including passion, loss, and the complexities of desire.
            <br />
            Night and Darkness: Words such as "night," "shadow," "darkness," and "silent" suggest themes related to
            darkness and the
            night.
            <br />
            This motif could symbolize various concepts, including mystery, solitude, introspection, and the
            unknown.
            <br />
            Journey and Exploration: Terms like "path," "dream," "sky," and "breeze" imply themes of journey and
            exploration, both
            physical and metaphorical.
            <br />
            This theme may involve quests for self-discovery, spiritual enlightenment, or
            the
            pursuit of
            dreams and aspirations.
            <br />
            Body and Sensuality:<br />
            The presence of words like "lip," "body," "sensuality," and "kiss" suggests themes
            related to
            physicality and sensuality.
            <br />
            This motif may explore the connections between the body and the self, as well
            as
            the
            experiences of pleasure, intimacy, and desire.
            <br />
            These themes provide insight into the overarching motifs and subjects explored within the book, reflecting
            its potential
            focus on the complexities of human emotions, relationships, and existential journeys.
            <br />
            This analysis can reveal a new interpretation that may not have been discernible before. As it’s obvious
            from word
            analysis, the count of negative and positive words are exactly the same. We know that “The Wall” poems
            were
            written
            during the last years of marriage of Forough when she was grappling with the problems of a housebound
            woman
            trapped in
            the bonds of marriage in the traditional society of that time while still loving her husband.
            <br />
            This
            struggling situation
            caused the passion, eagerness, and freshness of a young girl to fade. Though a mixture of hope and
            frustration existed
            in her equally. The Wall was dedicated to her ex-partner as a tribute to their deep love.

                <em><strong>Literary Analysis</strong></em>
                <br />
                Based on the most frequently recurring words in the provided list, here are five main
                themes of the
                book:
                <br />
                Night and Darkness: The prominence of words like "night," "darkness," "star," "moon," and "window"
                suggests
                a theme
                centered around nighttime and darkness. This motif may explore the mysteries, solitude, and
                introspection
                associated
                with the night, as well as the symbolism of darkness in literature.
                <br />
                Love and Relationships: The inclusion of words such as "love," "heart," "hand," "life," "body," and
                "scent"
                indicates
                themes related to love and relationships. This theme may involve the exploration of romantic
                relationships,
                emotional
                connections, and the experiences of love and longing.
                <br />
                Nature and Symbolism: Terms like "water," "fish," "flower," and "wind" imply themes of nature and
                symbolism.
                <br />
                This motif
                may involve reflections on the beauty and symbolism of the natural world, as well as the
                interconnectedness
                of humans
                with their environment.
                <br />
                Time and Transience: The presence of words like "day," "seventy," and "moment" suggests themes related
                to
                time and
                transience. This theme may explore the passage of time, the fleeting nature of moments, and the
                inevitability of change
                and impermanence.
                <br />
                Light and Hope: The inclusion of words such as "light," "life," and "hope" points to themes of light
                and
                hope. This
                motif may involve reflections on illumination, optimism, and the pursuit of brighter futures, as well
                as
                the
                symbolic
                significance of light as a source of guidance and inspiration.
                <br />
                <br />
                These themes offer insight into the overarching motifs and subjects explored within the book,
                reflecting
                its

                <p>
                  <em><strong>Literary Analysis</strong></em>
                  Here are five main themes of the book:
                  <br />
                  Nature and Garden: The repetition of words like "garden," "flower," "sun," "wind," and "season"
                  suggests
                  themes related
                  to nature and the environment. This motif may involve reflections on the beauty of the natural
                  world,
                  growth, change,
                  and the passage of seasons.
                  <br />
                  Time and Transience: The inclusion of words such as "time," "day," "night," "moment," and
                  "beginning"
                  indicates themes
                  associated with time and its passage. This theme may explore the fleeting nature of moments, the
                  cyclical
                  nature of
                  time, and reflections on beginnings and endings.
                  <br />
                  Love and Relationships:<br />
                  Terms like "love," "heart," "mother," and "hand" imply themes related to love and
                  relationships.
                  <br />
                  This motif may involve explorations of familial bonds, maternal love, emotional connections, and the
                  complexities of
                  human relationships.
                  <br />
                  Sensory Experience:<br />
                  The presence of words like "sound," "window," "cold," "look," and "lost" suggests
                  themes
                  related to
                  sensory experiences and perception.
                  <br />
                  This theme may involve reflections on sights, sounds, sensations, and
                  the impact of
                  sensory stimuli on human emotions and experiences.
                  <br />
                  Journey and Exploration:
                  <br />
                  The repetition of words such as "stop," "moment," and "lost" hints at themes of
                  journey and
                  exploration.
                  <br />
                  This motif may involve narratives of personal growth, self-discovery, and the quest for
                  meaning
                  or purpose.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These themes offer insight into the overarching motifs and subjects explored within the book,
                  reflecting
                  its
                  potential
                  focus on nature, time, relationships, sensory experiences, and personal journeys.

                <br />
                <br />
                After text analysis and extracting the most frequently used words in each book, a notable fact
                appeared
                that was not
                visible before.
                <br />
                We calculated the percentage of positive and negative words in each of Forough's books and
                compared the
                ratio of positive to negative words to examine the poet's emotional and mental states over different
                periods of her life
                through the lens of data analysis.
                <br />
                The interesting result of this statistical comparison was that the
                ratio of positive
                to negative words exactly correlates with the poet's emotional states in various stages of her life.
                <br />
                If we
                consider the
                Ballance Line in the chart below as the point of equilibrium between the poet's negative and
                positive
                mental states, we
                can consider periods where the ratio was below one as the darker periods of her life.
                <br />
                As it is evident,
                the poems she
                wrote in her first poetry collection "The Captive" exactly reflect her emotional states during the
                years
                of youthful
                love and romantic marriage.
                <br />
                In this book, the ratio of positive to negative words is 1.4. In her second
                book, published
                shortly after her divorce, that is, according to Farzaneh Milani, expressed her romantic feelings
                and
                heartaches with
                her ex-husband, the ratio of positive to negative words exactly reached 1.
                <br />
                This indicates that during the
                writing of
                this book, Forough had transformed from a cheerful girl to a balanced woman with a broader view on
                both
                the good and bad
                aspects of life, experiencing both exhilarating moments in her life and marital relationships and
                the
                challenges,
                humiliations, and regrets of a modern woman in a traditional society.
                <br />
                In her third book, "Rebellion,"
                published after
                her recovery trip to Europe for nerve and mental rejuvenation, dominantly containing the poems
                written
                during Forough’s
                dark days of life, her divorce, suicide, and long hospitalization, the ratio of positive to negative
                words
                dropped
                significantly below 1, a deficient number indicating her negative emotions and extreme despair.
                <br />
                During
                this period, as
                obtained from the word analysis, words like Cry, Hell, and Pain which were not prominent in
                Forough's
                earlier poems,
                were frequently used. Additionally, the word Darkness/Dark was used more than in all other Forough's
                works
                and is the
                most repeated word in this book.

                  Furthermore, Forugh felt immense shame and guilt due to separation from her beloved husband, the
                  distance
                  from her young
                  son, and her brief relationship with another man, whom she referred to as the major mistake of her
                  life.
                  So, words such
                  as hell, God, and pain emerged for the first time in her poetry and were repeated significantly in
                  her
                  third book
                  "Rebellion".
                  <br />
                  Her fourth book, "Another Birth," published long after her first three collections, significantly
                  reflects
                  an
                  improvement in her mental state and a resurgence of hope within her. This book was written after
                  Forugh's
                  inner journey
                  and numerous travels, as well as the profound effects of her courageous interactions with society.
                  The
                  ratio of positive
                  to negative words in this book is a meaningful 1.2, indicating Forugh's upward movement towards
                  finding
                  contentment in
                  life despite her realism.
                  <br />
                  Her final poetry collection, published posthumously, contains poems composed in the last four years
                  of her
                  short life.
                  <br />
                  These were years of brilliance, marked by her consecutive international successes and her profound
                  personal and romantic
                  relationship with Ibrahim Golestan, which played a significant role in shaping Forugh's exceptional
                  personality. In this
                  collection, the percentage of positive to negative words astonishingly exceeds 2.5, indicating the
                  predominance of
                  positive emotions and mental states in the poet.
                  <br />
                  This meaningful corelation between her life and the words she used in her poems is mainly because of
                  <br />
                  Forough’s unmasked
                  authenticity that distinct her from other poets. While many poets may present verses that differ
                  from
                  their everyday
                  lives and even produce beautiful poems, upon scrutinizing the life and conduct of the poet, one may
                  discern that the
                  poetry serves as a mere facade, diverging from the essence of the poet. Yet, the fabric of Forough's
                  poetry embodies her
                  genuine beliefs and convictions!
                  <br />
                  Forough Farrokhzad's poetry narrates the tale of her life and her
                  beliefs, a
                  captivating narrative filled with turbulence, defiance, and undoubtedly, love.
